# MatrixClient
A *hopefully* simple client for communicating over Matrix. The goal is to provide something that can be used on both the esp8266 and something like an Arduino Uno, and tires to have few dependencies.

**TODO:**
  * Lots and lots - this is very much a work in progress
  * Change rooms
  * Send/receive events (messages)
  * Anything else to be a good and useful client, but not use all available memory
